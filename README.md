# Kings-Corner
https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/kings-corner/  -  Computer version of the card game known as "Kings Corner" or "Kings in the Corner." User competes against the computer. My first fully fleshed program, sloppiness included. Depending on your IDE you may need to make a pathway to the image folder "cardset-oxymoron".
The file Kings.java contains the main() to run the program.
